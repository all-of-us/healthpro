        <p>The Participants by Lifecycle Phase is a bar chart showing the progression of participants through the registration process. This measures counts at various milestones and gates 'eligibility' based on how many participants have completed the upstream events. The time points show are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Registered</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Primary Consent</strong></li>

Samples Received is defined as participants for whom <em>4ml of blood or saliva</em> has been collected and received at the Biobank for sequencing. Core Participants are defined as any participant that has completed all of the previous milestones.</p>
        <p>Eligibility for Consent is defined as any participant that has registered. Eligibility for any milestone from PPI modules onward is defined as any participant that has completed the primary consent.</p>

        <h3>EHR Volume</h3>
        <p>The EHR Data:EHR Volume dashboard is a collection of visualizations and data tables that provides insight into the amount of EHR data that has been uploaded by various organizations over time. EHR Data is shared on a quarterly basis, so adjustments to the cutoff date will display metrics as of the most recent quarterly upload.</p>
        <h3>EHR Consent vs. EHR Data</h3>
        <p>This plot provides insight into a comparison between the number of participants who have signed the EHR consent (excludes the DV EHR Intent to Share consent) vs the number of participants for whom the program has received at least some EHR data. Note that the count of participants who have consented to share EHR data is being calculated based on participants paired with organizations that are uploading EHR data and not a total for participants (ex: Unpaired Direct Volunteers).</p>
        <h3>Organization Data</h3>
        <p>This data table will provide a participant funnel view that covers key markers in the participant journey. A list of additional column descriptions can be found below:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Organization Name</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Total Participants:</strong> Total number of participants who have signed the primary consent</li>
          <li><strong>EHR Consented:</strong> Total number of participants who have signed the EHR consent (excludes the DV EHR Intent to Share consent)</li>
          <li><strong>Core Participants (excludes Direct Volunteers):</strong> Total number participants with a PID, a signed primary consent, a signed EHR Consent (excludes the DV EHR Intent to Share consent), completed first three PPI Modules, submitted Physical Measurements and have a Biosample that has been received at the Biobank for sequencing</li>
          <li><strong>EHR Data Received:</strong> Total number of participants with EHR data</li>
          <li><strong>Last EHR Submission Date:</strong> Most recent date of EHR data upload by organization, pulled from bucket logs</li>
        </ul>
        <p><em>Note:</em> Participants who have signed the EHR consent and have EHR data may not have completed all necessary steps to become a Core participant. Similarly, Core Participants may have signed the EHR consent but the program may not have received EHR data for the individual yet.</p>
