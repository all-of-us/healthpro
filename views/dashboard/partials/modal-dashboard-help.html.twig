                <h3>General Usage/ Plot Options</h3>
                <p>To view any individual metric, select it from the dropdown in the <strong>Plot Options</strong> pane and the associated plot will automatically update. Every plot has an end date that specifies the last day of metrics used to compute the plot.</p>
                <p>Changing any value in the Plot Options pane will cause the associated plot to automatically update.</p>
                <h3>Advanced Filters</h3>
                <p>With any plot, you can filter the source data by selecting individual or groups of HPOs. This will calculate the selected metric by only using data corresponding to the selected centers. To view this data, select the desired centers individually and click <strong>Filter Results</strong>. You can also select/deselect entire groups or all centers by using the <strong>Group</strong> or <strong>All</strong> toggles, respectively.</p>
                <h3>Using Plots</h3>
                <p>All plots, whether bar- or map-based, can be zoomed or panned by either clicking and dragging or using the plot zoom controls in the upper right-hand corner of the plot. Every element displayed on the plot will contain additional information that is displayed on mouse hover. Double clicking any plot will reset the zoom to its default level. You can also export an image of the current view by clicking the camera icon in the plot control bar.</p>
                <h3>Available Dashboards</h3>
                <p>There are 4 available plots in the dashboard: <strong>Total Progress to Date</strong>, <strong>Real-Time Data</strong>, <strong>Participants by Region</strong>, and <strong>Participants by Lifecycle Phase</strong>.</p>
                <h4 class="text-primary">Total Progress to Date</h4>
                <p>This plot will show various participant metrics and their associated values grouped over time. The available
                metrics include:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Enrollment Status</strong>:
                    <ul>
                      <li><strong>Registered:</strong> A person who created an account by entering a name and either a mobile phone number or an email address and has chosen a language preference but has not yet completed the informed consent process. A registered participant has a unique AoURP participant identifier (PID).</li>
                      <li><strong>Consented:</strong> A person who meets the eligibility and inclusion criteria and is enrolled in AoURP. A consented individual has completed the primary informed consent process and the HIPAA Authorization/EHR consent (if available and where relevant, based on AoURP capacity to effectively search for and access records). A consented individual hasn’t yet participated in any research program activities such as completion of questionnaires or providing physical measurements and biospecimens.
                        <ul>
                          <li><em>Note:</em> DV Participants who have completed the primary informed consent process and the DV EHR Intent to Share are included in Consented participant counts.</li>
                        </ul>
                      </li>
                      <li><strong>Core Participant:</strong> A person who completed the required PPI modules and provided physical measurements and biospecimens. A core participant can contribute to other activities such as providing digital health data using sensor modules and/or wearables, if available.
                        <ul>
                          <li><em>Note:</em> Core Participant status requires receipt of sample for sequencing at the biobank.</li>
                        </ul>
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li><strong>Gender Identity</strong></li>
                  <li><strong>Age Range</strong></li>
                  <li><strong>Race</strong></li>
                  <li><strong>Total Registered Participants</strong></li>
                </ul>
                <p>The Total Progress to date plot has an additional start date to specify a discrete range of dates to calculate (this defaults to one week from the current date). You can also choose to see of rollup of values bucketed by days, weeks, or months by using the <strong>Interval</strong> dropdown. On bar charts, you can display column totals above each bar by clicking <strong>Show Column Totals</strong>.</p>
                <h4 class="text-primary">Participants by Region</h4>
                <p>The Participants by Region plot is a choropleth map of the United States showing counts of consented participants that correspond to geographic locations. These include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>State</strong> of residence</li>
                    <li><strong>Census Region</strong> of residence</li>
                    <li><strong>Recruitment Origin</strong> (what HPO a participant registered through)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The values shown on the map are calculated as a percentage against that particular metric's target goal for the current year. For States & Census Regions, this is one-third of one percent (0.333%) of the total population recorded in the 2010 United States Census. For Recruitment Origin, this is the target total registration goal for the associated center.</p>
                <p>The <strong>Color Profile</strong> dropdown allows you to re-color the map in a variety of shades (this only applies to the State and Census Region metrics).</p>
                <h4 class="text-primary">Participants by Lifecycle Phase</h4>
                <p>The Participants by Lifecycle Phase is a bar chart showing the progression of participants through the registration process. This measures counts at various milestones and gates 'eligibility' based on how many participants have completed the upstream events. The time points show are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Primary Consent</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Consent for enrollment</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Consent completed (both enrollment and health records)</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>PPI module on lifestyle</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>PPI module on overall health</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>PPI module on 'the basics'</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Baseline PPI modules completed (3 previous PPI modules)</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Physical measurements recorded</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Samples received</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Core participants</strong></li>
                </ul>
                <p>For the Registration, Consent, PPI modules, and Physical Measurements milestones, we are counting participants who have completed these milestones. Sample collection is defined as participants for whom <em>4ml of blood or saliva</em> has been collected and received. Core Participants are defined as any participant that has completed all of the above milestones.</p>
                <p>Eligibility for Consent is defined as any participant that has registered. Eligibility for any milestone from PPI modules onward is defined as any participant that has completed the primary consent for enrollment.</p>
